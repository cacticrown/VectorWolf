# VectorWolf

**VectorWolf** is a small, lightweight game engine/framework I built primarily for making my own games. It's simple, modular and gives you full control.
> ⚠️ **This engine was created primarily for my games and is not intended for public use.**

## Features

- **Scene-Entity-Component structure**  
- **Rendering system** with an API for custom renderers  
- **Easy to extend** – modular and flexible structure
- **Ogmo Editor support** - import Ogmo Tilemaps and Scenes
- **ImGui integration**

## Why?

I wanted a minimal engine without the complexity of larger tools. VectorWolf is a personal project, but feel free to use it or contribute if you find it helpful!

## Getting Started


Simply add the NuGet package to your `.csproj` like this:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="VectorWolf" Version="0.1.0" />
```
VectorWolf doesn't have any official documentation yet, so you'll need to look at the source.
