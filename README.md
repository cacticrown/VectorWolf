# VectorWolf

**VectorWolf** is a small, lightweight game engine/framework I built primarily for making my own games. It’s simple, modular and gives you full control.

## Features

- **Scene-Entity-Component structure**  
- **Rendering system** with an API for custom renderers  
- **Easy to extend** – modular and flexible structure

## Why?

I wanted a minimal engine without the complexity of larger tools. VectorWolf is a personal project, but feel free to use it or contribute if you find it helpful!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and add it to your project directly.  
VectorWolf doesn't have official documentation yet, so you'll need to explore the code to learn how it works.
